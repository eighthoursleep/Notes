## What is an Action Game?

- A set of actions responding to output 一系列针对输出的动作
  - Passive activity 被动行为
    - This sounds like the exact opposite of action

- Activity based on prior (active) input
  - Adventure/Horror games
    - This is opposite to the impression horror games give off
- What are "action skills"?
  - The player's ability to deal with a given situation

## Gameplay Systems

- What are gameplay systems?
  - The selling point of a game
    - The unique elements that define a game
  - Expanding features
    - Lateral expansion to prevent games from becoming too linear
  - Depth
- If a game has selling points A/B/C, expanding features D/E, and depth elements F/G:
  - Players complete the game having experienced A and B
    - They've completed and enjoyed the game
  - Players complete the game having experienced A,B, and C
    - They've completed the game and feel like they got a lot of it
  - Players complete the game having experienced A,B,C and D
    - They've complete the game, and become good at it in a variety of ways
  - Players complete the game having experienced A,B,C,D and E
    - "Wow! I didn't know you could do that! This game is awesome!!"
  - Players complete the game having experienced A,B,C,D,E and F
    - "I am a god among mortals!"
- How to approach the selling points of an action game
  - It's not about functional design
    - The question "What abilities shall we give the player?" never comes first
  - It's about situational design
    - The first thing to figure out is: "What kind of situations do we put the player in, and what are we going to make them do?"
- One more important things about the design of selling points:
  - When creating a game in a series, you already have an existing ability set to work with ,so:
    - It's easy to fall into the trap of changing A to A' or A+B, but this is a mistake
    - Always give top priority to situational design

## Replay Value

- What is replay value?
  - The point is not to force the player to keep playing
  - Replay value has to be linked to fun activities
  - It's essential that the player get to imrove their skills
    - This requires a structure that lets the player enjoy all of elements A,B,C,D,E, and F
    - Make the game feel like it was tailor-made for the player 让游戏感觉像是为玩家量身定做的

## Characters

- Action games let players enjoy a character's superpowers
  - Fulfilling the desire to transform
    - This requires main characters with rich personalities
  - Fight your way through any situation
- The order of designing unique characters with superpowers
  - Imagine the situation
    - Create an image board
  - Design the game's selling points
    - Functional design
  - Start designing the characters
- Character art design directly and strongly affects the user experience

## Story

- What purpose does story have in an action game?
  - The most important purpose is "Motivation"
  - Deep stories with lots of twists are not required 不需要有很多曲折的故事
  - The story should turn the designed situation into motivation in a natural way 故事应该以自然的方式将设计好的情境转化为动机

## High-level Design

- Not the same as level design

  - Considering the game flow in the largest possible unit 思考可能最大的游戏流程单位

- Simply bombarding players with constant excitement become numbing after a while 仅仅持续性使玩家兴奋，会使玩家过一会儿就对兴奋点麻木

- Create a tempo per stage 每个关卡制造一个节奏

  - Pacing is very important 节奏很重要

- Stage "Strength" 关卡强度

  关卡序号	设置强度（1-10）	玩家感受

  St. 1:					6							7

  St. 2:					4							4

  St. 3:					6							5

  St. 4:					7							8

  制作成本：6+4+6+7=23	制作效果：7+4+5+8=24

- Stage "Strength"(example of failed build-up)

  St. 1:	5	6	4

  St. 2:	6	5	5

  St. 3:	7	5	5

  St. 4:	8	6	4

  5+6+7+8=26	4+5+5+4=18

- With Transformers we focused on density

  - We didn't want players to put down the controller
